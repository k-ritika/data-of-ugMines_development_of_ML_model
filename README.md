# 🏗️ Development of Machine Learning Model for Optimizing Chain Pillar Size in Deep UG Longwall Coal Mining

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts optimal chain pillar dimensions in deep underground longwall coal mining operations. Chain pillars are critical for ground stability, safety, and resource recovery. By leveraging geological and geotechnical data, the model helps engineers make data-driven decisions to reduce failure risks and improve mine design efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict optimal chain pillar width and strength based on geological inputs
- Minimize ground control failures and enhance safety
- Integrate mining engineering principles with machine learning techniques

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and filtered outliers
  - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Created derived features from strata depth, rock strength, and stress zones
- **Model Development:**
  - Applied regression and classification algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
  - Evaluated models using RMSE, R², and cross-validation
- **Optimization:**
  - Used grid search and hyperparameter tuning to refine model performance
